# pyemma-tutorial

We strongly recommend to install the latest `pyemma` release (version 2.5.1 or later) from the anaconda Python distribution via

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pyemma
```

We will further make use of the `mdshare` package which is available (for Python3 only) via

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge mdshare
```

If you are not using the anaconda Python distribution, `pyemma` is also available via source installation from github. For more detailed installation instructions, please refer to http://www.emma-project.org/latest/INSTALL.html.
